**README- Poll System Backend**
(Full Backend Project built with Java, SpringBoot, H2, Postman).

**Planning \& Preparation**
First, I planned the entire system architecture.
I decided to build two separate microservices, each responsible for a different domain:

\#Users Service - handles user management.
\#Polls Service - manages questions, answers, and statistics.

Each service runs independently with its own H2 database.
Communication between them is handled strictly via REST API.
I chose the MVC architecture (Controller / Service / Repository) and defined a clear seven-step roadmap to ensure incremental progress, testing, and documentation.

**Step 1- Create the System**
I created two independent Spring Boot projects:
\#users-service - runs on port 8080.
\#polls-service - runs on port 8081.
Each project includes dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and H2 in the pom.xml file.
I verified that both services run properly and connect to their own in-memory databases.

**Step 2 - Users Service (User Management)**
I implemented the full MVC layers for managing users:
Entity (User), Repository, Service, and Controller.
Added validations, CRUD operations, and verified persistence in H2.
All endpoints were tested successfully in Postman.

**Step 3 - Polls Models Setup**
I created the basic model for Question in the Polls Service, including its entity and repository.
This stage established the database structure and prepared for CRUD logic and future features.

**Step 4 - Polls Controllers and Repositories**
I implemented full CRUD for questions through QuestionController, QuestionService, and QuestionRepository.
Verified that data was correctly saved, updated, and deleted in H2.
At this point, Polls Service became a working module for managing questions.

**Step 5 - Testing and Postman Collections**
I tested both services using Postman.
Users Service: full CRUD and validation.
Polls Service: CRUD for questions.

Created two Postman collection files:
Users Service.postman\_collection.json
Polls Service.postman\_collection.json

Both were used for manual API testing and verification with H2 databases.

**Step 6 - Inter-Service Communication**
I connected Polls Service to Users Service using REST.
When a user submits an answer, the Polls Service verifies the user's existence through the Users API.
Each service still uses its own H2 database with no shared data.
All API calls between the services worked correctly.

**Step 7 - Building the Complete Poll System (Answers + Statistics)**
This was the stage where I built the entire Poll System:
Added the Answer model and full CRUD logic.
Created the StatisticsController to calculate answers per user/question.
Linked everything together (Questions <-> Answers <-> Users).
Added a new Postman file: Polls Service - Answers \& Statistics.postman\_collection.json.
Verified all flows end-to-end: create users, add questions, submit answers, view statistics.

**System Testing (Postman + H2 Console)**
final tests for both services - the Users Service and the Polls Service - using Postman and the H2 Console.
The purpose was to verify that all system components work together properly, that data is saved correctly in both databases, and that all relationships between entities (Users <-> Questions <-> Answers) function as expected.
#Part A - API Testing with Postman#

All REST endpoints were tested separately for each microservice.
#Users Service (port 8080)
I tested all CRUD operations for users - including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting users.
I confirmed that user deletions also triggered the removal of related answers in the Polls Service via REST communication.
#Polls Service (port 8081)
I tested full CRUD functionality for questions and answers, ensuring that each question was linked to an existing user, and that each answer referenced both a valid question and user.
I also verified the statistics endpoint, which aggregates total counts and relationships between users, questions, and answers.

#Part B - Database Testing with H2 Console#

I verified that all data was correctly stored in the H2 in-memory databases of both services.
#Users Service: accessed via http://localhost:8080/h2-console
#Polls Service: accessed via http://localhost:8081/h2-console
Each service had its own independent H2 schema (usersdb and pollsdb), and all tables were automatically generated by Hibernate according to the entity definitions.
After running API operations in Postman, I confirmed that the inserted users, questions, and answers appeared correctly in their respective tables.

**All tests worked successfully**
